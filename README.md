# qemu

FIRST please know, though these are working for me for what I use DVSwitch-server for which uses the md380-emu, YOU ARE USING THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IS NOT SUPPRTED BY THE DEV TEAM.

These binaries were pulled from a Debian 11 install from both a Raspberry Pi and an AMD machine.
I backuped the original qemu-arm-static with cp ./qemu-arm-static ./qemu-arm-static.bak in its installed directory.

Download the file for your archetecture and rename it back to its original name of qemu-arm-static. 
You may need to make them executable again with chmod +x qemu-arm-static since I had these stored on a Windblows machine.

Now it should work for you but if not, AGAIN these are working for me for what I use DVSwitch-server for which uses the md380-emu, THIS MAY NOT WORK FOR YOU AND IS DEFINATELY NOT SUPPRTED BY THE DEV TEAM.
